I had good knowledge and interest in coding/ developing but I want to something unique/ tedious which gives best outcome interms of payscale. So while having a deep discussion with my relative Er. Dhiren Patel, I have finallized that I will pursue my carrer in Data Science and Long term goal would be becoming a data scientist. So training my brain likeway form today.

Researched many of the resources, roadmaps what to learn first etc. My maths was weak so I started with Statistics first I found a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZzq1zSL1bs and started with it.
